    title: "E-COMMERCE -  (Marketplace Platform with Commission & Cashback Engine)",
    shortDescription:

    overview:
      "A production-ready marketplace MVP featuring multi-role access, sales agent commission tracking, and automated customer wallet cashback systems integrated with backend APIs.",
 problem:
  "Traditional e-commerce systems do not natively support structured sales-agent commission models and automated cashback wallet logic. The goal was to design a marketplace that supports multi-role interaction with controlled business logic.",

challenges:
  "Ensuring accurate commission calculations and wallet balance consistency required careful validation logic and role-based controls. Maintaining secure transaction flows across user roles was a key engineering focus.",
role:
  "Designed and developed the entire application independently including frontend interfaces, backend API integration, database structure design, commission business logic implementation, and deployment configuration.",

impact:
  "Demonstrates ability to design complex business logic systems beyond standard CRUD applications, including financial commission workflows and incentive wallet automation.",
